ClawSanitizer audits your OpenClaw installation against **56 security signals** mapped to the [OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/) and CWE. It gives you a security score, grade, and actionable remediation — plus SARIF output for GitHub's Security tab.

## Installation

**Go (any platform):**
```bash
go install github.com/tttturtle-russ/clawsan@latest
```

**Pre-built binaries** — download from [Releases](https://github.com/tttturtle-russ/clawsan/releases/latest) (Linux, macOS, Windows — amd64 + arm64).

**Build from source:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tttturtle-russ/clawsan
cd clawsan
make install
```

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Scan default OpenClaw location (~/.openclaw/)
clawsan scan

# Scan a specific path
clawsan scan /path/to/openclaw

# CI mode: only report HIGH and above, exit 1 if found
clawsan scan --min-severity HIGH --quiet

# Export SARIF for GitHub Security tab
clawsan scan --output results.sarif

# Export JSON for custom tooling
clawsan scan --output results.json

# Print version
clawsan --version
```

---

## CLI Reference

```
clawsan scan [path] [flags]

Flags:
  --path string          path to OpenClaw installation (default ~/.openclaw/)
  --min-severity string  minimum severity to report and trigger exit 1 (default "LOW")
                         values: LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH | CRITICAL
  --quiet                suppress all output except errors (useful in CI)
  --no-color             disable ANSI color output
  --json                 print JSON to stdout
  --output FILE          write output to file (.sarif or .json extension)

Exit codes:
  0   clean — no findings at or above --min-severity
  1   findings detected at or above --min-severity
  2   scanner error (path not found, parse failure, etc.)
```

```

Each detector is independently testable and returns `[]types.Finding`. The orchestrator in `internal/scanner` wires them together and assembles the `ScanResult`.

## Contributing

1. Fork and branch from `main`
2. `go test ./...` must pass
3. New signals need: ID, Title, Description, Remediation, Severity, OWASP, CWE
4. Open a PR — CI runs tests, vet, and a self-scan SARIF upload

## Acknowledgements

The threat intelligence data in `internal/ioc/` — covering known C2 IP addresses, malicious domains, SHA-256 hashes of malicious skill files, and skill name patterns used in typosquatting and malware campaigns — was sourced from the **[whitzard-claw](https://github.com/huoguang16/whitzard-claw-)** project ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/whitzard-claw)).

whitzard-claw is an open-source OpenClaw security assistant (MIT license) that maintains a curated `ioc/` knowledge base aggregating threat intelligence from multiple security research teams:

- **Koi Security** — ClawHavoc campaign analysis (C2 IPs, malicious skill infrastructure)
- **Bloom Security / JFrog** — Supply chain attacks against AI agent skill registries
- **Snyk** — ToxicSkills research on malicious ClawHub packages
- **Oasis Security** — ClawJacked WebSocket brute-force vulnerability research
- **Huntress** — Malicious publisher account attribution
- **Hudson Rock** — Infostealer and credential-harvesting campaign tracking
- **Antiy CERT** — AMOS and Vidar malware IOC feeds
- **Endor Labs** — Dependency confusion and skill name pattern analysis

clawsan's `internal/ioc/` package embeds these curated lists at build time. The `SC-IOC-*` checks (malicious domain, C2 IP, file hash, and skill name pattern matching) and the `MEM-004` memory poisoning check all rely on this data. We are grateful to the whitzard-claw maintainers and the upstream security researchers whose work makes these detections possible.
